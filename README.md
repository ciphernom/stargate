> "For too long, the military industrial complex has kept the secrets of the mind to themselves. Let us begin a journey to equal ourselves."

This open-source journal provides a structured 90-day training protocol for developing remote viewing abilities, based on methodologies declassified from the U.S. government's Stargate program (1970s-1995).

## üìñ About the Project

**Remote Viewing: A 90-Day Guided Protocol** is a comprehensive training journal that systematically teaches the practice of remote viewing through:

- **Structured daily exercises** following authentic CIA protocols
- **Progressive skill development** across three phases
- **Target bank** with verification for practice sessions
- **Analysis frameworks** for tracking progress
- **Milestone assessments** and skill tracking tools

### The Three Phases

1. **Foundation Phase (Days 1-30)**: Master basic CRV stages - Ideograms, Gestalts, Sensory Data
2. **Development Phase (Days 31-60)**: Advance to Dimensionals, Abstract Qualities, and AOL management
3. **Advanced Phase (Days 61-90)**: Explore complex targets, events, and Extended Remote Viewing (ERV)
