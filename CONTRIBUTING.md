# Contributing to Through the Looking Glass

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project! By working together, we can help democratize consciousness exploration techniques and advance our collective understanding of human perception.

## üåü Our Philosophy

This project exists to make previously classified remote viewing protocols accessible to everyone. We believe in:
- **Open science**: Sharing knowledge freely
- **Rigorous methodology**: Maintaining the integrity of the original protocols
- **Community wisdom**: Learning from collective experiences
- **Respectful exploration**: Approaching consciousness research with humility

## üìã Code of Conduct

### Our Standards

- **Be respectful**: Honor different perspectives on consciousness and perception
- **Stay scientific**: Base discussions on evidence and experience, not belief
- **Share openly**: Document both successes and failures in remote viewing practice
- **Support beginners**: Remember everyone starts somewhere
- **Maintain integrity**: Don't modify core protocols without clear documentation

### Unacceptable Behavior

- Dismissing others' experiences without consideration
- Making unfounded claims about remote viewing abilities
- Using the project for commercial exploitation without attribution
- Harassment or discriminatory language of any kind

## ü§ù How Can I Contribute?

### 1. Target Bank Expansion

We welcome new practice targets! Good targets should:
- Have clear, distinctive features
- Be verifiable (photos, locations, objects)
- Cover diverse categories (natural, man-made, events, etc.)
- Include proper attribution if using others' images

**Format for new targets:**
```latex
% Target PX-XX
\cleardoublepageWithSymbol
\label{target:PX-XX}
\begin{center}
\Large\textbf{TARGET PX-XX}
\end{center}
\begin{mdframed}[backgroundcolor=white, linewidth=0.7pt, linecolor=rvprimary, shadow=true, shadowsize=1pt, shadowcolor=graydark!40, roundcorner=3pt]
\begin{tabular}{|p{3.5cm}|p{9cm}|}
\hline
\rowcolor{rvprimary!15}
\textbf{Target} & \textbf{Notes for Verification} \\
\hline
[Target Name] & [Detailed description for post-session verification] \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{mdframed}
```

### 2. Documentation Improvements

- Fix typos or grammatical errors
- Clarify instructions that may be confusing
- Add helpful examples or explanations
- Improve LaTeX formatting or structure

### 3. Design Enhancements

- Optimize page layouts for better usability
- Create alternative style templates
- Improve accessibility features
- Design new icons or visual elements

### 4. Translation

Help make this available globally by translating:
- The journal content
- README and documentation
- Target descriptions

### 5. Research Contributions

- Share statistical analyses of practice results
- Document effective training modifications
- Compile resources on remote viewing research
- Create supplementary training materials

### 6. Technical Improvements

- Optimize LaTeX compilation
- Create build scripts for different platforms
- Develop digital/app versions
- Improve font handling and compatibility

## üìù Submission Process

### For Small Changes (typos, minor fixes)

2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix/your-description`
3. Make your changes
4. Commit: `git commit -m 'Fix: Brief description'`
5. Push: `git push origin fix/your-description`
6. Create a Pull Request

### For Major Changes

1. **Open an issue first** to discuss the proposed changes
2. Wait for community feedback and approval
3. Fork and create a feature branch: `feature/your-feature`
4. Implement changes with clear commits
5. Update documentation as needed
6. Test thoroughly
7. Submit PR with detailed description

### Commit Message Format

```
Type: Brief description (max 50 chars)

Longer explanation if needed (wrap at 72 chars)

- Bullet points for multiple changes
- Keep it clear and concise

Fixes #issue-number (if applicable)
```

Types: `Fix:`, `Feature:`, `Docs:`, `Style:`, `Target:`, `Translation:`

## üé® Style Guidelines

### LaTeX Style

- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Comment complex sections
- Use meaningful command names
- Keep line lengths reasonable
- Follow existing document structure

### Writing Style

- Use clear, accessible language
- Maintain scientific neutrality
- Avoid making absolute claims
- Respect the original protocol terminology
- Be encouraging but realistic about results

### Target Descriptions

- Be specific but avoid leading the viewer
- Include multiple identifying characteristics
- Use neutral, descriptive language
- Provide enough detail for clear verification

## üß™ Testing Your Contributions

### For LaTeX Changes

1. Compile with both XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
2. Check all page layouts render correctly
3. Verify no orphaned references
4. Test on different page sizes if applicable

### For New Targets

1. Have someone blind-test the target
2. Ensure description allows clear verification
3. Check image rights if applicable
4. Verify target number doesn't conflict

### For Documentation

1. Check all links work
2. Verify code examples run
3. Have someone unfamiliar review for clarity

## üöÄ Pull Request Process

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
2. **Description**: 
   - What changes were made and why
   - Any breaking changes
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots if applicable
3. **Checklist**:
   - [ ] Code follows project style
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Tested thoroughly
   - [ ] No merge conflicts
4. **Review**: Address feedback promptly
5. **Merge**: Maintainers will merge once approved

## üí° Project-Specific Guidelines

### Protecting Protocol Integrity

- Core CRV stages should not be modified without extensive discussion
- Any protocol changes must be clearly marked as variations
- Original Stargate methodology should be preserved

### Handling Sensitive Topics

- Respect that RV is controversial in mainstream science
- Present information objectively
- Avoid making medical or predictive claims
- Focus on the training methodology, not outcomes

### Community Building

- Share your practice experiences in Issues/Discussions
- Help newcomers with questions
- Organize practice groups or sessions
- Contribute to statistical tracking efforts

## üéØ Priority Areas

Current areas where we especially need help:

1. **Statistical Analysis Tools**: Methods for tracking success rates
2. **Practice Group Coordination**: Tools for organizing blind target sessions
3. **Mobile/Digital Versions**: Making the journal more accessible
4. **Research Compilation**: Gathering scientific papers on RV
5. **Video Tutorials**: Creating supplementary training content

## üìÆ Getting Help

- **Questions**: Open an issue with the `question` label
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for general topics
- **Bug Reports**: Use the bug report template
- **Feature Requests**: Use the feature request template
